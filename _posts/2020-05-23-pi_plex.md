Setting up a Plex server on the Raspberry Pi and updating with `sudo apt-get update` can be done with the following commands:
```
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
curl https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-keys/PlexSign.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo deb https://downloads.plex.tv/repo/deb public main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/plexmediaserver.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install plexmediaserver
```

## Exfat Harddrive
Commands listed here are based on [this guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/external-storage.md)

```
sudo apt-get install exfat-fuse
sudo apt-get install exfat-utils
```

### Automatically Mounting

First you need to get the UUID of the hard drive.
`sudo blkid`

Create a directory for your drive.
`sudo mkdir /disks/bigdrive`

Then edit this file
`sudo nano /etc/fstab`

And add a line such as this: `UUID=5C24-1453 /mnt/mydisk FSTYPE defaults,auto,users,rw,umask=000 0 0`
